This is part one of two post on me opening PowerShell and then finding out something peculiar…

If you use or want to start using PowerShell what’s the first thing you need to do:

OPEN IT!!!! (oh sorry didn’t mean to yell, but I talk a little louder when I figure out new things…not really).

Anyway, I thought I would go through how I open the PowerShell prompt..&#160; In this post I am dealing strictly with Windows 7 x64, simply because that is what my desktop is loaded with.&#160; So with that if you have Windows 7 (or Vista for the most part) you know there are a few ways to open a program.

1) Old fashion way: Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Windows PowerShell

As you can see since I’m running an x64 operating system I have the x86 (32-bit) version of the console as well as the x64 (64-bit).

2) Vista/Windows 7 way: Start &gt; Type in Search Box “Windows PowerShell” (or just PowerShell)

Once you open it (or any program) there are a few things you can do to make the program more accessible and quicker to get to, so you don’t have to keep doing the above steps.&#160; This is where I found something out that was new to me.] Once you open PowerShell it opens up in the taskbar of Windows.&#160; If you have Windows 7 you know Microsoft greatly improved the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-taskbar" target="_blank">function of the taskbar</a>. When a program is opened you can actually “pin this program to the taskbar”, which is similar to adding it to the <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/quickly_edit_quick_launch_icons_in_windows_xp_2003.htm" target="_blank">quick launch toolbar from Windows XP</a>.

Well something else added to this menu when you open a program was the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/jump-lists" target="_blank">jump list</a>.&#160; This is the menu that pops up when you right-click on an open program (or can be seen in the Start menu to).

This is the part that was new to me, not Jump List in general, but what shows up for the PowerShell program.&#160; If you are new to PowerShell (as I am) you may need to do a Bing/Google Search on this, but the “Import System modules” is the big one. What exactly did I find when I clicked on this? You will have to find out on part 2, which you might want to wait until then or, if you dare, see if you can figure out what I found peculiar.

To be continued…
