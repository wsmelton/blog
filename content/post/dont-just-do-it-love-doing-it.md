I attended a meeting today with the founder of the company I am now employed by. It was a session to hear the story and the background of the company and founder himself. It was very interesting. One part of the discussion near the end was a subject area that I think can define a person's character and demeanor to some extent. It was regarding dealing with the policy and tools required for various processes that are to be used in my day-to-day responsibilities.

There are things that we all have to learn when we first start with a company. I think every company does things differently; be it HR policy or tools that the company offers for you to use in your job. It always takes getting familiar with those processes before you just get used to doing them. In some cases you may still wonder, or think, "this is stupid even knowing why and there is no reason to do it". I personally think that understanding the "why" and having an open mind about things can make work life much more simple. I think a person that has the right character and professionalism will not think any process or tool is necessarily stupid to use regardless of the reasoning behind it. Whether it be due to some event, incident, or idea anything can have room for improvement. Every process or tool always has room for improvement, if you don't allow for that you will never get anywhere, in life or career. I mean, we all have room for improvement and processes or tools do as well. If you put out a product at version 1.0 and never improve on it making it 1.5 or 2.0, how long do you think it is going to last.

I have worked with folks in various places that did what they need, to just get from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and then can go home. I have seen folks come to work with their head down and no passion for what they are doing. It all had really nothing to do with the company, but the individual. If I had followed that same regime I do not think my career would be where it is today. I love what I do for a living, no matter the company. SQL Server (and PowerShell) never bring about a boring day...maybe a slow one at times, but never boring. It is only never boring if you make it that way and work doing something you love.

I worked for companies that never used me to my full potential, at least that I think I have, and even some that refused to let me help on tasks that I was capable of doing to get it done more efficiently. (_Think two people are better than one type situation._) I believe I am finally with a company that offers me the environment to reach my full potential, and go beyond it.

Here is to the future!
