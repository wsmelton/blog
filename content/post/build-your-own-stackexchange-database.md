Have you ever wanted to be like <del>Mike</del> Brent and <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2014/01/how-to-query-the-stackexchange-databases/" target="_blank">have your own local, sample StackExchange database</a>? Do you know what PowerShell is?

If you at least answered yes to the first and last question, I am here to help. I published a PowerShell script on GitHub and created a dedicated page to show you how I solved the problem with PowerShell. Travel over to me resource page page: <a href="/stackexchange/" target="_blank">StackExchange</a> and you will see what I am talking about.

Is it the best PowerShell script for doing the job? Possibly. It accomplishes what I want it to, which is enough for me. I caveat this on the page, but to not let your hopes get to high I was not able to load the StackOverflow data with this script. It is more than likely just my laptop could not handle that much data. If I get a chance, I will try using this on a more beefy server to see if it will work.

Good luck and happy data-fishing.
