Certifications...it's a hot topic for some people.  The main argument comes from those that get them and those that don't.  If you are a student of <a href="http://sqlchicken.com/sql-university/" target="_blank">SQL University</a> you may have caught Thomas LaRock's (<a href="http://thomaslarock.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> `|` <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sqlrockstar" target="_blank">twitter</a>) lecture on <a href="http://thomaslarock.com/2010/07/sql-university-certification-week/" target="_blank">Certification Week</a>

Anyway I was actually logging into the MCP site (not linking it because a login required) and found a new feature that I don't recall being there..."Virtual Business Card".Â  They have added in the ability to create a business card of sorts as a web page.

It takes you through a nice little wizard driven site that you pick a theme and then add all your information on the card:

Once you get everything setup you can preview your site and it will provide you with the HMTL code to copy and paste in your e-mail or on your blog:
<a href="https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/VBCServer/shawnmelton/card" target="_blank">View my MCP Certifications (card)</a>
<a href="https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/VBCServer/shawnmelton/profile" target="_blank">View my MCP Certifications (profile)</a>

That is a nice little tool I believe.  I'm not much for carrying around business cards.  Most companies I have worked for so far did not bother to get me one and I just have not gone and bought my own yet.
