Before I get to that step let me tell you a story...I try to keep up with webcast and virtual presentations as much as I can, especially ones that deal with either SQL Server or PowerShell. I do tend to miss a lot of them. I do find the needle in the hay stack every now and then though.

I remember being up late one night last year (around 1:00 AM CST). I had <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/desktop/" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a> up and caught a tweet by Buck Woody (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/buckwoody/" target="_blank">blog</a> `|` <a href="http://twitter.com/buckwoody" target="_blank">twitter</a>) about a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/buckwoody/archive/2010/05/25/data-tier-applications-in-sql-server-2008-r2.aspx" target="_blank">LiveMeeting event fixing to start for the Adelaide SQL Server User Group in Australia</a>, which would have been about 5 PM or 6 PM their time I guess. It was about the DAC and UCP features in SQL Server 2008 R2. It was a very good learning experience, even at that time of night.

I found that I actually missed a good one the other day. I don’t get on Twitter all the time when I am not at work, or actually doing something on my computer at home. So I tend to be one of the few that actually back tracks in the timeline to see what went on in the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=twitterverse" target="_blank">twitterverse</a>. I came across this tweet by Tim Radney (<a href="http://timradney.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> `|` <a href="http://twitter.com/tradney" target="_blank">twitter</a>):

I obviously saw this after the fact and was like, “What the truck, what did I miss!!??!!”. Well apparently what I missed was a SQL PASS Performance Virtual Chapter webcast hosted by Paul Randal (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul" target="_blank">blog</a> `|` <a href="http://twitter.com/PaulRandal/" target="_blank">twitter</a>). I also found later down the timeline this tweet by <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlpass" target="_blank">@sqlpass</a>:

Which it was not all that bad since the SQL PASS VCs are recorded and after a day or so put out on the web for you to view at anytime. However I did feel bummed out about it, there is just something about watching and experiencing it live.

I was trying to figure out how I can keep up with the VC presentations that occur and started perusing the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org" target="_blank">SQL PASS site</a>. I did not see that PASS offers any kind of email alerts for these things. I did find that they offer an <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/Home/RSS.aspx" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> for just about everything. Which I frequent my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> account a good bit throughout the day. So, I downloaded the OPML file and imported it into my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> account. So now I can get information from PASS on press releases, news, in-person events, and online events. All from the comfort of my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>. (Did I mention I like using my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>?!!!)

If I had already done that I would have come across this posting under the PASS Online Events RSS feed in Google Reader:

So yeah I missed that one, but now I know I can catch the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/Events/ctl/ViewEvent/mid/521.aspx?ID=559" target="_blank">SQL PASS Professional Development VC event</a> with Joe Web (<a href="http://webbtechsolutions.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> `|` <a href="http://twitter.com/joewebb" target="_blank">twitter</a>).

So now for that step to help you remember everything:

**Step 1: Accept the fact that you will not be able to remember everything and move on.**
