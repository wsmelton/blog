Located in the Southeast US, I grew up in the country playing with tractors and farm equipment. My college career started out wanting to go into Wildlife Science, but biology proved to be my weakness. I ended up switching to a degree in information systems and made it out of college.

I have worked in various operation support roles in my career. Which while some may look at my resume and say I was jumping between jobs, there is more to the story. I worked as contractor with the military for a good portion of my career, so as the contract went to another company I followed along. One advantage that has given me over my career is I have been involved in the whole development process (*maybe not at the same company*) and seen it from various sides of the table.
